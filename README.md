I'll try to create a podcast website using [Vue.js](https://cli.vuejs.org/) and the [Mixcloud API](https://www.mixcloud.com/developers/).

The podcast is actually a latin american radio program called [Campus Latino](https://www.radiocampus.be/les-communautaires/campus-latino/) which is part of the [Radio Campus Bruxelles 92.1 FM](https://www.radiocampus.be) broadcast schedule. You can listen to the show every Sunday between 11:00 and 14:30.

Episodes are uploaded weekly to the Mixcloud platform under the [Radio Campus account](https://www.mixcloud.com/radiocampusbruxelles/). 

Since Radio Campus hosts plenty of shows in their mixcloud account our shows are somehow lost in the sea, so the goal is to make an independent website where people can browse only between Campus Latino uploaded episodes.
