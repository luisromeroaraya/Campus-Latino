# [Campus Latino podcast website](http://www.campuslatino.ml)
I'll create a podcast website using [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and the [Mixcloud API](https://www.mixcloud.com/developers/).

## About Campus Latino
<img width="250" src="https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000035004735-ai31p0-t500x500.jpg" alt="Campus Latino">

The podcast is actually a latin american radio program called [Campus Latino](https://www.radiocampus.be/les-communautaires/campus-latino/) which is part of the [Radio Campus Bruxelles 92.1 FM](https://www.radiocampus.be) broadcast schedule. You can listen to the show every Sunday between 11:00 and 14:30.

## Campus Latino in the Mixcloud platform

Episodes are uploaded weekly to the Mixcloud platform under the [Radio Campus account](https://www.mixcloud.com/radiocampusbruxelles/).

## Objective

Since Radio Campus hosts plenty of shows in their mixcloud account our shows are somehow lost in the sea. The goal of this project is to make an independent website where people can browse only between Campus Latino uploaded episodes.

## Current status

The site is currently working and deployed [here.](http://www.campuslatino.ml)
